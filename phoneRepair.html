            <!--<p>This site is here to benefit you with your device and help me keep in proper contact with you, the customer. as I continue on my journey down the path of device repair I have noticed that fixing things is soemthing i enjoy doing more than I could have imagined. but I have run out of things to fix. sure there is a broken phone screen to replace here and there but it is not enough to keep me occupied. So, i have decided to write up a website to help others with their device for a small fee, to keep my hands busy and to help out those who dont have the experince or just dont want to risk making the issue worse with their device.</p>-->
